ASIO Rec and Play
==========================

This software is a simple program to route the audio from one ASIO interface to another.
Useful to send 5.1/7.1 surround sound from a X-Fi to an HDMI receiver, or allow lossless 5.1 surround sound from a X-Fi Titanium HD.

Still WIP, but accepting pull requests.
