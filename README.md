ASIO Rec and Play
==========================

This software is a simple program to route the audio from one ASIO interface to another.
Useful to send 5.1/7.1 surround sound from a X-Fi to an HDMI receiver, or allow lossless 5.1 surround sound from a X-Fi Titanium HD.

Still WIP, but accepting pull requests.

It is recommended to enable the X-Fi Equalizer and set the pre-amp/level to lower values, such as -12dB or even -24dB if you use the crystalizer with large settings.
For some reason clipping is happening when recording but it doesn't happen with other softwares such as RMAA. This problem is currently being investigated.
